  Consider that in the history of many worlds there have always been disposable
  creatures. They do the dirty work. They do the work that no one else wants to
  do, because it's too difficult and too hazardous. With an army of Datas, all
  disposable, you don't have to think about their welfare, or you don't think
  about how they feel. Whole generations of disposable people.
