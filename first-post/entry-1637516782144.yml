  The head of that image was of fine gold, its chest and its arms were of
  silver, its abdomen and its thighs were of copper, its legs were of iron, and
  its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay. You looked on until a stone
  was cut out, not by hands, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and of
  clay and crushed them. At that time the iron, the clay, the copper, the
  silver, and the gold were, all together, crushed and became like the chaff
  from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away so that not a
  trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a
  large mountain, and it filled the whole earth.
