  Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having
  little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
  shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the
  world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the
  circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it
  is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
  pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I
  meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
  requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping
  into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off - then, I account
  it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol
  and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
  quietly take to the ship.
