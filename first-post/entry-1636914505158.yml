  How dare you! You who consort with Romulans! Invoke my father's name in
  support of your traitorous arguments! It is an affront to everything I hold
  dear. And to hear his name used to subvert the United Federation of Planets.
  My father was a great man. His name stands for principle, and integrity! You
  dirty his name when you speak it! He loved the Federation! But you, Captain,
  corrupt it! You undermine our very way of life! I will expose you for what you
  are! I've brought down bigger men than you, Picard!
