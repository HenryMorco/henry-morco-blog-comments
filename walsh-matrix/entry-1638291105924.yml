  The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it’s
  scientific truth, or historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding
  principle upon which Starfleet is based. If you can’t find it within yourself
  to stand up and tell the truth about what happened you don’t deserve to wear
  that uniform.
